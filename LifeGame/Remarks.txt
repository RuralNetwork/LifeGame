------------Code layout conventions-------------
- Use properties instead of fields
- Use "lowerCamelCase" for private properties/methods/fields
- Use "UpperCamelCase" for public properties/methods
- Use "UpperCamelCase" for classes, structs & enums
- Use "CAPITAL_UNDERSCORE" for consts

- Use structs instead of class for ease of full copy (just an assignment), but they should be passed as parameter as less as possible

- When downcasting (ex. from Thing to Being) use the "as" operator instead of () prefix operator beacuse it doesn't check if operation succeed


When testing, consider using <gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> and switching to 64 bit for more space allocation for a single object (the ram could be not enough though)
